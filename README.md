# SheepShifter

This is a Kotlin port of the [SheepShift](https://github.com/BuddaT/LD35) game, created for the
[Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/) game jam #35. The code was hand-converted to Kotlin and was done as
 an exercise in learning the language so will not be especially idiomatic. To run, execute 
 `gradlew :desktop:run`
