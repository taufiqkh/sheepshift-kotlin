# SheepShift

This is a Kotlin port of the [SheepShift](https://github.com/BuddaT/LD35) game, that I 
created with [Budda](https://github.com/BuddaT) for the [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/) game jam #35. The code was 
hand-converted to Kotlin and was done as an exercise in learning the language so will not be 
especially idiomatic. To run, execute `gradlew :desktop:run`
